# K-Lane Detection Frameworks
This is the documentation for how to use our detection frameworks with K-Lane dataset.
We tested the K-Lane detection frameworks on the following environment:
* Python 3.7 / 3.8
* Ubuntu 18.04
* Torch 1.7.1
* CUDA 11.2


# Requirements
1. Clone the repository
```
git clone ...
```

2. Install the dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Getting Started
1. To download the dataset, log in to <a href="https://kaistavelab.direct.quickconnect.to:54568/"> our server </a> with the following credentials: 
      ID       : klaneds
      Password : Klane2022
2. Go to the "File Station" folder, and download the dataset by right-click --> download.
   Note for Ubuntu user, there might be some error when unzipping the files. Please check the "readme_to_unzip_file_in_linux_system.txt".
3. After all files are downloaded, please arrange the workspace directory with the following structure:
```
KLaneDet
├── annot_tool
├── baseline 
├── configs
├── data
      ├── KLane
            ├── test
            ├── train
                  ├── seq_1
                  :
                  ├── seq_15 
├── logs
```

# Training Testing
* To test from a pretrained model download the pretrained model from our Google Drive <a href="" title="K-Lane Dataset">Model</a> and run
```
python validate.py ...
```
* Testing can be done either with the python script or the GUI visualization tool. To test with the GUI visualization tool, please refer to the <a href = "./docs/visualization.md" title="Visualization Tool"> visualization tool page </a>
